Context:
The IR represents an event-based runtime monitor.

Event-based semantics:
- The specification defines constraints over events.
- Events correspond to method calls or returns.
- Violations occur when an event happens in an invalid context.
- The monitor does not maintain explicit states.

Event-based IR structure:
- "type" must be "event"
- "events": list of monitored events
- "constraints": list of event constraints
- "violation_message": message emitted when a constraint is violated

Constraints:
- Do not invent events or methods not implied by the description.
- Keep constraints minimal and precise.
- Do not introduce states or temporal automata.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.
