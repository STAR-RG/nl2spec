Context:
The IR represents a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) monitor.

LTL semantics:
- Specifications are expressed as temporal logic formulas.
- Events correspond to atomic propositions.
- Violations occur when the formula is falsified.

LTL IR structure:
- "type" must be "ltl"
- "events": list of atomic propositions
- "formula": LTL formula
- "violation_message": message emitted when the formula is violated

Constraints:
- Use standard LTL operators (G, F, X, U).
- Do not invent events not implied by the description.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.
